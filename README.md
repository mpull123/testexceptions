Here's a README section for your TestExceptions Java program:

# TestExceptions

## Overview
TestExceptions is a Java program designed to demonstrate how to handle exceptions in Java using try-catch blocks.

## Usage
To use the TestExceptions program, follow these steps:
1. Compile the TestExceptions.java file: `javac TestExceptions.java`
2. Run the compiled program: `java TestExceptions`

## Features
- Demonstrates handling ArithmeticException and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java.
- Provides examples of try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

## How it works
1. The program initializes an array `myArr` of size 10 and two integer variables `x` and `y`.
2. It attempts to divide `y` by `x` in a try block, which causes an ArithmeticException due to division by zero.
3. The program catches the ArithmeticException and prints an error message.
4. It then attempts to access an element at index 10 in the array `myArr`, which causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
5. The program catches the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and prints an error message.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Command-line interface for compiling and running Java programs
